# What SecureAD is

An Active Directory security audit tool. **It reads a forest once, seals that reading as evidence,
and everything it says afterwards it says from that file.**

The product makes two separable claims, and keeping them separable is the whole design:

1. **This is what your directory said, at this moment.** Provable years later, on a machine that
   never saw the forest.
2. **This is what we conclude from it.** Re-runnable under better rules without touching claim 1.

**This is orientation, not authority.** Nothing here states the product's position; only a record in
[`decisions/`](decisions/) with `Status: Accepted` does that. Where this file and a record disagree,
the record wins and this file is wrong.

## The shape of a run

| Stage | What happens | State |
|---|---|---|
| Connect | Find the forest itself; climb an ordered ladder of protection and record which rung each controller answered on | built |
| Preflight | Prove a controller can serve what it will be asked, before the run commits | built |
| Capture | Read objects, permissions, group memberships, schema, extended rights, SYSVOL/GPO files | built |
| Seal | Fingerprint the evidence. Coverage and any deliberate exclusion recorded inside it | built |
| Judge | Stream the bundle once, offer every object to every scheduled rule, write findings to a separate store | built, two rules |
| Read back | Run library, directory tree, object detail | built |
| Findings, dashboard, reports | — | not built |

`0008` fixes the boundary: **the only component that touches a domain controller is capture.** A
screen showing a permission is reading a file, not asking the directory.

**The application is the product; the command line runs unattended.** The owner's words, 2026-08-26:
*"this whole app is a GUI, the cli is just to capture overnight."* The GUI is where an operator
works and is what every screen is designed for. The command line exists so a long run can happen
overnight without the application open, and **it is intended to grow judging too** — the owner,
later the same day: *"i will be making it so the user can run the audit and it complete the judging
via CLI, so it can run overnight."* So the command line is not capture-only forever; it is the
unattended path, and the GUI is the worked path.

## How judging works

Decided, built and measured — see [`layers/judgement/`](layers/judgement/).

- **One pass over the bundle, not one per rule.** Every object is streamed once and offered to every
  scheduled rule while it is in hand, so judging forty rules costs the same read as judging one.
- **A rule judges one object and nothing else.** No forest, no sibling lookup, no second pass, so a
  rule cannot quietly acquire an input it never declared.
- **A rule declares the data it reads, or the build fails** (`0083`).
- **Atomic per rule, not per run.** A rule that throws loses only itself; its partial findings are
  discarded, because a partial verdict would read as a complete one.
- **Findings live outside the seal** (`0085`), in a store that is disposable and rebuildable.

**The one acknowledged gap:** a rule resting on group membership needs a wider shape than this, and
that shape does not exist yet. It is the only architectural question left open.

## The five commitments

1. **Evidence is permanent.** Sealed once, never re-sealed. Re-analysis copies the source and seals
   the copy; the original is opened read-only (`0021`).
2. **A gap is a fact about the capture, never about the forest** (`0002`). A domain left out by
   choice never looks like one that could not be reached (`0063`); an unfinished run reports nothing
   at all rather than partially (`0068`).
3. **Say what you know, with its uncertainty — except when claiming completeness** (`0086`). Silence
   is reserved for *this is complete*, where a wrong answer makes someone stop looking.
4. **Severity belongs to the rule and the customer cannot move it** (`0066`, `0082`) — lowering a
   severity is quieter than accepting a finding and leaves nothing behind.
5. **A finding carries typed evidence and a permanent identity** (`0080`, `0023`, `0024`), so an
   acceptance made today still attaches after a rename.

## What it deliberately is not

- **Not a live tool.** No live effective access, inheritance, ACL compare or delegation reporting
  (`0008`).
- **Not a policy compliance checker.** Password policy is captured and shown; nothing grades it.
  Plenty of software measures password strength.
- **Not tunable.** No assessment modes (`0031`), no customer-editable catalogue (`0082`).
- **Not an auditor of audit configuration.** The SACL is never requested (`0036`).

## Where it departs from the predecessor

There is an old application. It worked, the owner ran it, and it is why this rebuild knows what it
is aiming at. **Its architecture is not this one's, and nothing below is a design to follow.** Its
inventory and component map were archived and are deliberately absent from this repository; the
owner keeps the old repository and consults it himself. Do not ask for it.

Thirty-nine of seventy-nine decision records reference it. The load-bearing differences:

| | Old app | Here |
|---|---|---|
| Live directory | kept a live connection alongside the bundle | removed entirely (`0008`) |
| Sealing | signed at the end over evidence *and* conclusions; re-analysis re-signed in place | evidence sealed alone at capture, never re-sealed (`0030`, `0085`) |
| Analysis | eleven dependent phases writing into the same file | one streaming pass into a separate store |
| Failure | phases fault-tolerant, degraded results still presented | unfinished run reports nothing (`0068`) |
| Severity | overridable by policy file | fixed by rule card (`0066`) |
| Capture scope | two class filters as radio buttons | every class except a shipped noise list (`0034`) |
| Schema partition | not read | read every run (`0014`) — what makes object-specific ACE evaluation possible |
| Vocabulary | *Accept* on screen, *Suppression* in code | one word, **finding**, everywhere (`0066`) |

**A question the owner has already answered is a defect in this repository.** When he answers one,
it belongs here, in the same turn.
